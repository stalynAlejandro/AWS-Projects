# AWS-Projects

## What is SST?
https://sst.dev/chapters/what-is-sst.html

We are going to be using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and a host of other AWS services to create our application.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 

You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. 
Since these services run on AWS, it can be tricky to test and debug them locally.
